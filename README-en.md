# 🗝 Login
- Two method：
  - Encrypted file login: select the encrypted file saved when registering and enter the password
  - Private key login: enter the private key
# 📃 Rent
1. Download SSH tool [`MobaXterm`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RPuF9x20oFYNsfPw03F2wFVmelo1npUr)
2. Open 🚀`AI Power` website, click “machine llist”, wait about 10 seconds for the list of available machines to be displayed. Then choose one server to trial or rent. It is recommended to set a little more time, when the time is over, the system will automatically shut down the server. If the task runs out in advance, you can go to "my GPU list" and cancel the rental, the rest of the time will be returned to your account by DBC.

9. After successfully logging in, you can use the server normally. You can manage the server files on the left and  there is a terminal on the right. Enter the `server file name .py` to run the python script, which has been preinstalled with Pytorch, Tensorflow, and so on the right. During formal training, it is recommended to use the screen command (`screen -S name`) to create an offline terminal. The training file on the offline terminal is more stable. Even if you exit locally, the server will continue to execute the script. The next time you log in to the server, you can use the command `screen -r -d name` to enter the previously created terminal.

- By configuring `X11-uploding`, you can even write scripts directly in the local graphical interface or display the graphical interface of the server-side software.
